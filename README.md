The project involves developing an Android application designed to assist 
students in submitting details about their absences. The application features a user 
login system and a form where students can provide information about the reason for 
their absence, along with an attached certificate. Once submitted, the data is stored in 
Firebase for easy retrieval and management. Additionally, the application sends the 
submitted information to a designated email address for administrative purposes. This 
ensures that student absences are documented and communicated efficiently. The 
project leverages modern technologies such as Java, XML, and Firebase to create a 
streamlined and user-friendly experience.
